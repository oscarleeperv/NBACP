This repository showcases my National Basketball Association College to Professional (NBACP) personal project.
My project uses professional and college basketball data to predict NBA rookie season performance statistics in the 2024-25 regular season. 

Process:
1. Requested data from the [NBA stats website](https://www.nba.com/stats) using the [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api).
2. Filtered data for NBA rookie seasons from the last decade (2014-15 to 2023-24 regular seasons) with prior American college basketball seasons.
3. Used data to train linear regression models to predict rookie season performance statistics.
4. Analyzed regression models.
5. Scraped data college player data of the 2024 NBA draft from [Sports-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/).
6. Used models and data to predict the rookie season performance statistics for the first 10 college players selected in the 2024 NBA draft.

Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Statsmodels module, Pandas Python module, BeautifulSoup4 Python module.
