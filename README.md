# NBACP
This repository showcases my National Basketball Association College to Professional (NBACP) personal project.
My project uses professional and college basketball data to predict NBA rookie season performance statistics in the 2024-25 regular season. 

Process:
1. Requested data from the NBA stats website using the [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api).
2. Filtered data for NBA rookie seasons from the last decade (2014-15 to 2023-24 regular seasons) with prior American college basketball seasons.
3. Used data to trained regression models to predict rookie season performance statistics.
4. Refined regression models using statistical tests. 

Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn Python library, Pandas Python library
